This is a tailor made front-end application developed using React for a medical hospital. The application provides an intuitive user interface to manage hospital operations and improve the patient experience. The app is developed in a modular way and can be easily extended and customized to suit the specific needs of the hospital.

Getting Started
To get started with the application, follow the instructions below:


Install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

Copy code
npm install
Start the application using the following command:

sql
Copy code
npm start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

Features
The application includes the following features:

1. Patient Management
The application provides a dashboard to manage patient information such as name, age, contact details, and medical history. The dashboard also allows hospital staff to schedule appointments and manage patient queues.

2. Doctor Management
The application allows hospital staff to manage doctor information such as name, specialization, contact details, and availability. The application also includes a scheduling system that allows hospital staff to assign doctors to specific patient appointments.

3. Medical Records Management
The application allows hospital staff to manage patient medical records, including test results, diagnoses, and treatments. The application also includes a search functionality that allows hospital staff to easily locate specific medical records.

4. Billing and Payment
The application includes a billing and payment system that allows hospital staff to manage patient bills and payments. The system includes an invoice generator and a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
